    <h4>#Net is already here.</h4>
    <p>
      you can add or update your #Net profile here:
      <a href="signed://*/*/add-profile.html">add profile</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      you can upload files on the #Net here:
      <a href="signed://*/*/upload-file.html">upload-file</a>
    </p>
    <br />

      #Net is not Web3.0, not yet. But it is the first step to achieve really decentralized web. And make no mistake - we are not talking about decentralized internet - internet IS decentralized by design. We are talking about decentralized web, which (sadly) is not decentralized for now.

      For now big bros own the content generated by users, as well as they own the suggestion algorithms, and by them they actually own ours preferences, develop ours habits, and in the end - they own us, which I can not agree. I'm not gonna fight this, I AM fighting this.
    </p>
    <p>
      #Net scatters out ownership of content throughout all the nodes. Anyone can start #Net node, hold whatever he/she wants, any chunk of global #Net storage, deliver it whoever he/she wants, in general: your net - your rules. And after #Net have grown and develop capacity comparable to the big bros - it will become much easier to develop/publish new services. There will be time when we will really own our Net.

      Of course it's not done deal yet. There will be growing pains, a lot of them. There will be scepticism and rejection. There will be the fight. But I can promise one thing - it won't be boring. Join me and let's change the world together, it's kind of high time!

      Nice motivation speech. And how I'm gonna change this world, exactly? Well, it's coming soon...
